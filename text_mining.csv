Endoscopic plastic or metallic stenting, and balloon dilation represent the gold standard treatment for BBS. Side-by-side insertion of multiple plastic stents is a very effective treatment option for BBS following cholecystectomy or liver transplantation. This strategy has a low recurrence rate on long-term follow-up, with better results than fully covered self-expandable metal stents (FC-SEMS). FC-SEMS seems to have an advantage and higher stricture resolution rate in patients with BBS secondary to chronic pancreatitis. Dilation of dominant biliary strictures in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis has a lower rate of infective complications than the stenting treatment. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography represents a safe and effective approach to BBS, with a very high success rate, especially when such cases are managed in a multidisciplinary setting.","['https://sdfestaticassets-eu-west-1.sciencedirectassets.com/shared-assets/24/images/elsevier-non-solus-new-grey.svg', 'https://sdfestaticassets-us-east-1.sciencedirectassets.com/prod/afe12190ac710772112f0f86c7de648c102fd84f/image/elsevier-non-solus.png', 'https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2213179515X00022-cov150h.gif', 'https://sdfestaticassets-eu-west-1.sciencedirectassets.com/shared-assets/26/images/wordmark-elsevier.svg']"

Consequences of porphyria include photosensitivity, liver damage and increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma, neurovisceral involvement, including seizures. Fluorescent porphyrins that include protoporphyrin-IX, uroporphyrin and coproporphyrin, are photo-reactive; they absorb light energy and are excited to high-energy singlet and triplet states. Decay of the porphyrin excited to ground state releases energy and generates singlet oxygen. Porphyrin-induced oxidative stress is thought to be the major mechanism of porphyrin-mediated tissue damage. Although this explains the acute photosensitivity in most porphyrias, light-induced porphyrin-mediated oxidative stress does not account for the effect of porphyrins on internal organs. Recent findings demonstrate the unique role of fluorescent porphyrins in causing subcellular compartment-selective protein aggregation. Porphyrin-mediated protein aggregation associates with nuclear deformation, cytoplasmic vacuole formation and endoplasmic reticulum dilation. Porphyrin-triggered proteotoxicity is compounded by inhibition of the proteasome due to aggregation of some of its subunits. The ensuing disruption in proteostasis also manifests in cell cycle arrest coupled with aggregation of cell proliferation-related proteins, including PCNA, cdk4 and cyclin B1. Porphyrins bind to native proteins and, in presence of light and oxygen, oxidize several amino acids, particularly methionine. Noncovalent interaction of oxidized proteins and porphyrins leads to formation of protein aggregates. In internal organs, particularly the liver, light-independent porphyrin-mediated protein aggregation occurs after secondary triggers of oxidative stress. Thus, porphyrin-induced protein aggregation provides a novel mechanism for external and internal tissue damage in porphyrias that involve fluorescent porphyrin accumulation.","['https://sdfestaticassets-eu-west-1.sciencedirectassets.com/shared-assets/24/images/elsevier-non-solus-new-grey.svg', 'https://sdfestaticassets-us-east-1.sciencedirectassets.com/prod/afe12190ac710772112f0f86c7de648c102fd84f/image/elsevier-non-solus.png', 'https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/S2352345X.gif', 'https://sdfestaticassets-eu-west-1.sciencedirectassets.com/shared-assets/26/images/wordmark-elsevier.svg']"

Nevertheless, as with all particulate raw materials, it can be questioned if and to what extent particles with critical fibrous dimensions might be generated by the handling or machining of this material. In order to investigate any tendency of PVA fibres to release airborne particles with critical fibrous dimensions (WHO fibres), static and/or personal samples were taken in eight fibre-cement factories at locations where potential exposures to PVA fibres were expected to be the highest. The following locations were surveyed: the PVA fibre weighing station, where PVA bales are opened mechanically and the PVA fibres are dispersed and weighed in a dry state; the fibre-cement slate punching machine; the slate ‘riven edge’ cutting machine or sheet sawing machine, whichever was present in the respective factories. Since cellulose fibres are an important constituent of fibre-cement, the organic fibre concentrations observed at the machining operations include cellulose. At each factory a control sample was taken in open air. Sampling, sample preparation and sample analysis by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were performed according to standard German procedures. Only very low number concentrations of organic WHO fibres, ranging from below detection limit to 0.006 f/ml, were found. These levels are lower than the typical levels of organic fibres commonly found in the normal personal environment (0.009–0.02 f/ml), stemming from the release of particles by a person's activities and from clothing and other textiles (bed sheets, blankets, pillow,...).We conclude that the handling of PVA fibres as well as the machining of PVA and cellulose fibre containing cement products in the fibre-cement factories surveyed have a low potential to release fibres with critical fibrous (WHO) dimensions.","['https://sdfestaticassets-eu-west-1.sciencedirectassets.com/shared-assets/24/images/elsevier-non-solus-new-grey.svg', 'https://sdfestaticassets-us-east-1.sciencedirectassets.com/prod/28f7974af6f6f13c799a04c30c77072a7446ba94/image/elsevier-non-solus.png', 'https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/S00034878.gif', 'https://sdfestaticassets-eu-west-1.sciencedirectassets.com/shared-assets/26/images/wordmark-elsevier.svg']"

A thermally desorbed adsorbent preconcentrator within the instrument is used to increase sensitivity and compensate for background water vapor. Calibrations were performed for breath and dry nitrogen samples in Tedlar bags spiked with 16 individual solvents and selected binary mixtures. Responses were linear over the 50- to 400-fold concentration ranges examined and mixture responses were additive. The resulting library of vapor calibration response patterns was used with extended disjoint principal components regression and a probabilistic artificial neural network to develop vapor-recognition algorithms. In a subsequent analysis of an independent data set all individual vapors and most binary mixture components were correctly identified and were quantified to within 25% of their actual concentrations. Limits of detection for a 0.25 l. sample collected over a 2.5-min period were <0.3×TLV for 14 of the 16 vapors based on the criterion that all four sensors show a detectable response.

Therefore, it is questionable whether exposure to power frequency magnetic fields is the cause of the increased breast cancer risk seen in these occupations.","['https://sdfestaticassets-eu-west-1.sciencedirectassets.com/shared-assets/24/images/elsevier-non-solus-new-grey.svg', 'https://sdfestaticassets-us-east-1.sciencedirectassets.com/prod/28f7974af6f6f13c799a04c30c77072a7446ba94/image/elsevier-non-solus.png', 'https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/S00034878.gif', 'https://sdfestaticassets-eu-west-1.sciencedirectassets.com/shared-assets/26/images/wordmark-elsevier.svg']"

This study aimed to detect the alterations in the topological organization of structural covariance networks of ALL patients.This study included 28 ALL patients undergoing chemotherapy and 20 matched healthy controls. We calculated the gray matter volume of 90 brain regions based on an automated anatomical labeling template and applied graph theoretical analysis to compare the topological parameters of the gray matter structural networks between the two groups.The results demonstrated that both the ALL and healthy control groups exhibited a small-world topology across the range of densities. Compared to healthy controls, ALL patients had less highly interactive nodes and a reduced degree/betweenness in temporal regions, which may contribute to impaired memory and executive functions in these patients.These results reveal that ALL patients undergoing chemotherapy treatment may have decreased regional connectivity and reduced efficiency of their structural covariance network. This is the first report of anomalous large-scale gray matter structural networks in ALL patients undergoing chemotherapy treatment and provides new insights regarding the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the chemo-brain network.","['https://sdfestaticassets-eu-west-1.sciencedirectassets.com/shared-assets/24/images/elsevier-non-solus-new-grey.svg', 'https://sdfestaticassets-us-east-1.sciencedirectassets.com/prod/28f7974af6f6f13c799a04c30c77072a7446ba94/image/elsevier-non-solus.png', 'https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/S10766332.gif', 'https://sdfestaticassets-eu-west-1.sciencedirectassets.com/shared-assets/26/images/wordmark-elsevier.svg']"

In search of an ideal analgesic for common acute pain - ScienceDirect,"['Nicholas D.', 'Moore']","['Ibuprofen', 'Pain', 'NSAIDs', 'Ideal analgesic', 'Inflammation']","The choice of an oral analgesic is an important determinant in achieving effective pain relief. Properties of an ‘ideal analgesic’ required for the management of acute pain are discussed and current evidence for the suitability of available analgesics – acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (such as ibuprofen), opioids and combination therapy – is reviewed. The hypothesis that an ‘ideal analgesic’ for acute pain should have a rapid onset of action, act over an extended period of time, reduce awareness of pain quickly and minimise interruption by pain, be well tolerated and produce analgesia over a wide range of pain types in different patient populations, is proposed herein. Currently available analgesics may fulfil only some of these characteristics and, because individual patient response also varies, the challenge is to define what constitutes an acceptable analgesic for a specific patient or pain type.Various tools for measurement of each of these characteristics exist, but there is currently no single measure to determine the ‘ideal analgesic’ for a specific patient with a specific pain type that takes into account all the characteristics of an ‘ideal analgesic’ and provides an overall measure to quantify the quality of relief produced.","['https://sdfestaticassets-eu-west-1.sciencedirectassets.com/shared-assets/24/images/elsevier-non-solus-new-grey.svg', 'https://sdfestaticassets-us-east-1.sciencedirectassets.com/prod/28f7974af6f6f13c799a04c30c77072a7446ba94/image/elsevier-non-solus.png', 'https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1366007109X00045-cov150h.gif', 'https://sdfestaticassets-eu-west-1.sciencedirectassets.com/shared-assets/26/images/wordmark-elsevier.svg']"

Patients who had received remifentanil infusions were matched by age, procedure, and duration of anaesthesia to those who received sufentanil infusions. Data included patient demographics, total intraoperative and postoperative opioids, and self-reported pain scores. Postoperative pain was managed with morphine patient controlled analgesia, and acetaminophen and diazepam as needed.Forty-four children (13.5 ± 3 years) were included. Demographic and procedural data were similar between groups. There were no differences between remifentanil or sufentanil groups in high pain scores (5.3 ± 2.4 vs. 5.7 ± 2.6, respectively) or cumulative morphine requirements (1.02 ± 0.32 mg/kg vs. 1.07 ± 0.48 mg/kg) during the first 24 h after surgery.This study found no difference in opioid consumption between children who received remifentanil versus sufentanil infusions.

The electronic health record was queried for CTPAs ordered for adult patients in the emergency department. We assessed the following patient factors: age, gender, body mass index, number of comorbidities, race, and ethnicity, provider factors: type (resident, fellow, attending, physician assistant) and environment factors: test time of day, season of visit, and crowdedness of the department.A total of 14,782 CTPAs were reviewed, of which 1366 were found to be positive for PE, resulting in an overall CTPA yield of 9.24%. Provider type was not associated with a difference in yield. Testing was less likely to be positive in younger patients, females, those with lower body mass indexes and those identifying as Asian or Hispanic. Testing was also less likely to be positive when ordered during the overnight shift and during the winter and spring seasons.Our study identified several patient and environmental factors associated with low CTPA yield suggesting potential targets for overtesting.

Premature termination of epidural analgesia—A prospective analysis to improve quality - ScienceDirect,"['F.', 'Heid', 'T.', 'Piepho', 'S.', 'Stengel', 'A.', 'Hofmann', 'J.', 'Jage']","['Regional anaesthesia', 'Epidural analgesia', 'Post-operative pain therapy', 'Quality assurance']","Epidural analgesia (EA) is a gold-standard in post-operative pain control. Therefore, modern treatment concepts targeting early patient recovery regularly implement EA. Due to its increasing impact, EA should meet high quality standards in respect to application and maintenance. Though, daily practice often reveals EA-related problems, our investigation aimed to improve EA quality by assessing incidence and reasons of undeliberate, premature termination of post-operative EA.In the first step all patients with post-operative EA were retrospectively studied covering a 6-month period (group 1). We analysed incidences and reasons of undeliberate termination of EA. Thereafter we modified our treatment protocols (preferential thoracic EA, continuous peripheral blocks, low concentrated local anaesthetic solutions, standardized co-medication). This was followed by a prospective analysis of all EA patients for another 6 months (group 2).NoneModified treatment protocols reduced the rate of premature termination of EA from 24% to 14%. Particularly, we noted less motor impairment but still this rate is disappointing. The increasing rate of catheter dislocations underlines that a continuous analysis of all treatment aspects must be compulsatory.","['https://sdfestaticassets-eu-west-1.sciencedirectassets.com/shared-assets/24/images/elsevier-non-solus-new-grey.svg', 'https://sdfestaticassets-us-east-1.sciencedirectassets.com/prod/28f7974af6f6f13c799a04c30c77072a7446ba94/image/elsevier-non-solus.png', 'https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1366007109X00045-cov150h.gif', 'https://sdfestaticassets-eu-west-1.sciencedirectassets.com/shared-assets/26/images/wordmark-elsevier.svg']"

In healthcare 4.0, the patient’s records are stored in electronic health record (EHR) repository which may be loacted either at a centralized or distributed locations to help the Doctors to easily access the patient’s healthcare data from anywhere at any time. As this data is accessed from the database repository using an open channel, i.e., the Internet, so, security and privacy are major concerns while accessing it from any location. Motivated from these facts, in this paper, we propose a biometric-based authentication scheme to ensure secure access of the patients EHR from any location. In the proposal, we first identified various security threats and challenges in accessing EHR from the database repository. Then, the secure biometric-based scheme is designed which is validated using the Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool.
