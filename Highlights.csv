Despite advances in modern genome and transcriptome analysis, the controversy of the three different theories on drug resistance and tumor progression, namely dynamic intratumor heterogeneity, pre-existing minor genomic clones and tumor ecosystem, is unresolved. Moreover, evidence on transcriptional heterogeneity suggests the necessity of a drug bank for individualized, precise drug-sensitivity prediction. We propose a cancer type- and stage-specific clinicogenomic and tumor ecosystemic concept toward cancer precision medicine, focusing on early therapeutic resistance and relapse."

Microfluidic organs-on-a-chip is a useful platform with widespread applications mainly in drug screening and pathological studies. Organ-on-a-chip models are created to recapitulate the structural, microenvironmental and physiological functions of human organs. Recently, bioprinting has been applied to fabricate organ-on-a-chip models owing to its ability to print multiple materials and cell types simultaneously with good spatial resolution and reproducibility. This enables the creation of a biomimetic microenvironment with heterogeneous 3D structures. Functional vascularized tissue structure can be printed directly enabling fluid flow for transport of nutrition, gaseous exchange and removal of waste. We examine the integration of microfluidic and bioprinting technologies for organ-on-a-chip applications and discuss the future trends and challenges."
2,"Highlights•Current treatments for AMD and the need for LAD are summarized.•Key considerations for development of LAD technologies are detailed.•Currently marketed products that could or do utilize LAD approaches are reviewed.•Emergent LAD technologies for current and future therapies are considered.Long-acting delivery (LAD) of ocular therapeutics has potential to improve the standard of care for ocular diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), by increasing patient compliance and reducing overall treatment burden on patients and healthcare providers. Although relatively few ocular LAD technologies are currently on the market, a variety of emergent and novel protein engineering-based technologies are being investigated in both the laboratory and clinical settings. Here, we review some of the key indications and treatments that would benefit from the development of LAD for the treatment of ocular diseases and examine the current state of LAD technologies that leverage protein-engineering approaches as well as nascent technologies with potential for future impact."

To enable timely implementation of value-based clinical care and payment approaches, it is important to look beyond usual timescales to inform decision makers about forthcoming disruptive technologies early. Horizon scanning could represent an efficient tool in support of decision making and rational use of available resources. Different horizon scanning programmes exist in Europe and there is a need for further international cooperation between competent authorities. In relation to this, the present review aims to highlight the importance of early information availability and illustrates the Italian Medicines Agency Horizon Scanning System in the context of the European regulatory network."

5,"Highlights•Understanding human skin models encourages their use in xenobiotic metabolism testing.•Skin models indicate relevant expression and activity of phase II metabolizing enzymes.•Skin shows properties of chemical detoxification and elimination in vitro and ex vivo.•More physiologically relevant models (e.g., skin-on-a-chip) are expected in the near future.Understanding skin metabolism is important when considering drug discovery and safety assessment. This review compares xenobiotic skin metabolism in ex vivo skin to reconstructed human skin and reconstructed human epidermis models, concentrating on phase I and phase II enzymes. Reports on phase I enzymes are more abundant than for phase II enzymes with mRNA and protein expression far more reported than enzyme activity. Almost all of the xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes detected in human skin are also present in liver. However, in general the relative levels are lower in skin than in liver and fewer enzymes are reported."

Here, we detail the challenges in assessing the safety of novel LAD technologies, and well as the most common types of toxicity encountered during early toxicity testing. A detailed understanding of the route of administration, pharmacology, and functionality and/or pharmacokinetics (PK) of the LAD, along with all of its component parts, including the active pharmaceutical ingredient and excipients, is crucial for the successful development of next-generation long-acting ocular therapeutics."
7,"Highlights•The eventual candidate drug is often synthesized before or in early lead optimization.•A well-defined candidate drug target profile is key to accelerate drug discovery.•A screening cascade should provide effective filtering of compounds.•Line-of-sight is needed in early discovery for rapid identification of candidate drugs.•The goal should be clear from the start of the drug discovery phase.The eventual candidate drug (CD) is often already synthesized during early drug discovery but not nominated until much later. To facilitate the rapid identification of a potential CD, a thoroughly worked-out CD target profile (CDTP) with criteria acceptable for the disease target product profile (TPP) is required at the start of lead generation (LG). In addition to driving the compound property optimization, the preclinical project team has to understand the ultimate goal to be able to rapidly identify and progress a potential CD. A screening cascade with meaningful and well-balanced progression criteria based on the CDTP is required to rapidly filter out unwanted compounds and to progress a potential CD through the cascade to candidate selection."
8,"AbstractRecent research strongly supports the hypothesis that posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can be accompanied by obesity and related metabolic disturbances. The mechanisms of these associations are however still not well defined, although disturbed functions in the sympathetic-adrenergic nervous system together with the disturbed release of hormones via the endocrine HPA (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal) axis apparently play a role. Leptin resistance and ghrelin excesses might contribute to a disturbed hypothalamic function, and also disturb other cerebral functions, leading to dysfunctional reward signaling and uncontrolled appetite combined with a tendency to alcohol abuse. Secondarily, cortisol stimulation will contribute to the development of central obesity which is known to facilitate the development of metabolic syndrome, including slightly increased levels of inflammatory biomarkers such as C-reactive protein and fibrinogen. While previous therapeutic strategies have focused on early psychotherapeutic interventions in PTSD, the present review emphasizes the importance of better therapeutic approaches regarding the somatic correlates of the syndrome. Strict regulation of dietary meals and food composition with minimal intake of sweets and saturated fat, as well as alcohol avoidance, can provide a basic therapeutic framework. A cognitive psychotherapeutic approach with graduated desensitization toward trigging factors, combined with pharmacotherapy, is discussed in the present review."
9,"AbstractMitochondria-derived peptides (MDPs) are a series of peptides encoded by mitochondrial DNA, and have similar functions to mitochondria. At present there are three types of MDPs that have been found, including Humanin, MOTS-c and SHLP1-6. They are new metabolic regulators of human body, and play a cytoprotective role in maintaining mitochondrial function and cell viability under pressure. Increasingly researchers have demonstrated that MDPs have proved effects on cell survival, metabolism, response to stressors, and inflammation in vivo and vitro. Recently with the advance of research, it have shown that MDPs have significant effects on the development of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). In this review, we will cover the relationships of MDPs with cardiovascular risk factors, myocardial ischemia, reperfusion injury, myocardial fibrosis, and coronary microcirculatory dysfunction, and also their possible pathogenic mechanisms. MDPs are considered to be novel biomarkers or therapeutic targets for CVD."
10,"Highlights•Spatial disaggregation of GNBs.•Animal manure as the main driver in agricultural pollution hotspots.•Identification of large temporal changes in GNB (±55–200 kg N ha−1), and high NUE values (>90%).•The accuracy of the estimates depend on the overlap between agri-environmental and socioeconomic conditions.•The municipality scale as the optimal resolution to identify pollution hotspots.AbstractGross nitrogen balances (GNB) at the national level are a broad indicator of reactive nitrogen (N) pollution but the identification of pollution hotspots is necessary for designing cost-effective abatement policies. This requires a spatial disaggregation of GNBs to finer resolutions, but key inputs are often only available at high spatial scales. Modelling offers a method to provide these inputs but introduces additional error. Here we develop methods to estimate the main inputs (manure, synthetic fertiliser) and outputs (roughage feed and crop products) for mainland Portugal for the NUTS2, NUTS3 and municipality levels for the years 1989, 1999 and 2009. Our results show that despite the declining of the mainland GNBs over this period (47 to 38 kg N ha-1),the range of GNBs at progressively finer resolutions increased from 26 to 95 at the NUTS3 to −50–963 kg N ha−1 at the municipality levels. The increased concentration of livestock in some areas appears to be leading to an inefficient use of manure for crop production whereas there appears to be a depletion of soil N stocks in other areas. A comparison of our results with those from Denmark leads us to conclude that themunicipality level is the most suitable to identify hotspots, even thougherrors can arise when there is a poor correspondence between agrienvironmental conditions and the socioeconomic administrative boundaries at which statistical data are often available."
11,"Highlights•Average SOC sequestration rate was 0.35 ± 0.11 Mg ha−1 y−1.•SOC sequestration rate of bare fallow was 0.11 Mg ha−1 y−1.•SOC sequestration was greater under perennial than annual crops.•C retention was lower for crop residues (6.1%) than for amendments (22%).AbstractChanges in soil organic carbon (SOC) content depending on different factors are extensively investigated when the soil is in steady-state equilibrium between formation and decomposition of soil organic matter. However, studies of SOC formation and dynamics in initally organic matter free soil are rare. Evolution of soil organic carbon was studied in a field experiment established in 1964 on a carbonaceous glacial till soil with very low initial SOC content (1.28 g kg−1). The effects on SOC content changes of bare fallow, barley and different perennial fodder crops such as grasses, clover-grass mixture, galega, hybrid lucerne and a turfgrass mixture, with or without mineral N and PK fertilisation and manure, were studied. There were 19 treatments in total and most had unchanged plant cover composition throughout the experiment. During 1964–2014, SOC stock increased in all treatments, by 0.11 Mg ha−1 y−1 in bare fallow and by at most 0.50 Mg ha−1 y−1 in the treatment with hybrid lucerne and manure. Average SOC sequestration rate was 0.35 ± 0.11 Mg ha−1 y−1. SOC changes were highly correlated with estimated C inputs and were therefore higher in treatments with perennials than with an annual barley crop. C retention efficiency for total crop-derived C inputs and for organic amendments was 6.1% and 22%, respectively. Water-soluble C measured in 2014 increased linearly with SOC, indicating that the quality of recently formed SOC was not strongly affected by the treatments. However, water-soluble C as a fraction of SOC was significantly lower in treatments with legumes than in treatments with bare fallow or a barley or grass crop. These results demonstrate that the quantity and quality of C inputs were both main drivers for observed changes in SOC. However, C retention efficiency of C inputs was relatively low. This may be related to soil texture with high sand proportion, suggesting that SOC sequestration rates in light-textured soils may be lower than expected even in case of low initial SOC content."
12,"Highlights•Taxonomic groups differ in species richness of agroforest versus forest.•78–99% of ant species may be in common between agroforest and forest.•Agroforest biodiversity integrated into forest biodiversity connectivity.•Agroforestry increases land area with high biodiversity connectivity by 60–80%.AbstractAgroforestry systems maintain intermediate levels of biodiversity between natural forests and purely agricultural land-uses and may therefore increase connectivity or sustain biodiversity in fragmented forest landscapes. This hypothesis is tested by comparing the species richness and similarity in species composition between forest fragments and agroforestry systems in two landscapes in Guatemala. Connectivity indices were calculated based on the similarity of biodiversity held between forest and agroforestry. Tree and ant species richness was significantly higher for forest than agroforestry land-uses. Conversely, species richness of leaf hoppers (Cicadellidae) was lower in forests compared to agroforests. Chao-Sorensen estimates indicated a high proportion of ant species were shared (0.78–0.99) between different agroforestry land-uses and forest fragments, but lower proportions of tree (0.39–0.55) and leaf hopper species (0.42–0.65). Including the contribution of agroforestry systems in estimates of forest connectivity, based on their biodiversity relative to forest, substantially increased the land area rated with high connectivity (by 100–300%) and forest edge connectivity (by 70–170%), but had negligible impact on land area rated as dense forest. The major forest fragments in the two landscapes were linked by land rated as medium connectivity for forest biodiversity. Thus, agroforestry contributes to the capacity of the landscape to support biodiversity, but only partially increases connectivity between forest fragments in the two landscapes studied. If these benefits are to be sustained, consideration needs to be given to the incentives for land-owners to maintain agroforestry systems."
13,"Highlights•Grazing exclusion does not improve soil or vegetation in comparison to grazed systems.•Grazing exclusion is less likely to negatively affect woodlands, deserts and forests.•Continuous grazing does not affect soil and livestock performance and distribution.•Rotational grazing is less likely to decrease vegetation and livestock performance.•SDF and HILF are more likely to impact negatively on livestock productivity.AbstractRangelands represent 91% of the surface devoted to livestock production and a high proportion of them are exposed to some sort of degradation. Considerable research interest has been centered in the effect of grazing strategies on different indicators of rangeland sustainability (e.g., vegetation dynamics, soil properties, livestock productivity and grazing distribution). Considering the large amount of experimental evidence collected during a century of range science, a quantitative study assessing the performance of grazing schemes is timely and necessary. Therefore, we assessed the performance of grazing strategies on sustainability indicators worldwide, considering rangeland type (i.e., grasslands, shrublands, woodlands and forests) and other management variables (e.g., livestock type, grazing level, paddock sizes, precipitation) through a meta-analysis using experimental publications. Our results show that complete destocking does not improve soil or vegetation in comparison to grazed systems, but it could have less negative impacts if it is applied on woodlands, deserts and forests, particularly in areas of higher precipitation. Even though continuous grazing was thought as detrimental, we only observed negative impacts on vegetation on woodlands or under heavy grazing levels. Moreover, continuous grazing is less likely to impact negatively on livestock productivity in forest ranges. Also, it can maintain grazing distribution (except in woodland ranges) when applied for shorter periods of time. For multi-paddock schemes, we observed that rotational grazing is less likely to impact negatively on vegetation under moderate grazing levels, while Savory grazing method is more likely to show negative impacts on livestock productivity (particularly when applied for short time periods). Although many grazing schemes are applied worldwide, their effects can be very different in different range types. Here we provide a quantitative assessment of under which scenarios the different strategies can have negative, positive or neutral outcomes on rangelands. In addition, other management decisions, such as grazing intensity, livestock type and the length of the application period, together with environmental factors such as precipitation level, showed to be key to prevent negative impacts of grazing schemes on rangeland sustainability. Considering that the length of the application periods was very influential for many grazing schemes and indicators, we believe this is highlighting the need for more adaptive grazing strategies with more flexible decisions to allow rangeland sustainability. Finally, we found important information gaps, particularly related to potential interactions with livestock type, alternative rest periods length in rotational schemes, and notably about socio-economic factors. Filling these gaps could lead to more integrative range science and management."
14,"AbstractHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the deadliest cancers due to its complexities, reoccurrence after surgical resection, metastasis and heterogeneity. In addition to sorafenib and lenvatinib for the treatment of HCC approved by FDA, various strategies including transarterial chemoembolization, radiotherapy, locoregional therapy and chemotherapy have been investigated in clinics. Recently, cancer nanotechnology has got great attention for the treatment of various cancers including HCC. Both passive and active targetings are progressing at a steady rate. Herein, we describe the lessons learned from pathogenesis of HCC and the understanding of targeted and non-targeted nanoparticles used for the delivery of small molecules, monoclonal antibodies, miRNAs and peptides. Exploring current efficacy is to enhance tumor cell response of chemotherapy. It highlights the opportunities and challenges faced by nanotechnologies in contemporary hepatocellular carcinoma therapy, where personalized medicine is increasingly becoming the mainstay.

15,"AbstractThe study focused on the fluid-bed granulation process of a product with two active pharmaceutical ingredients, intended for coated tablets preparation and further transfer to industrial scale. The work aimed to prove that an accurate control of the critical granulation parameters can level the input material variability and offer a user-friendly process control strategy. Moreover, an in-line Near-Infrared monitoring method was developed, which offered a real time overview of the moisture level along the granulation process, thus a reliable supervision and control process analytical technology (PAT) tool. The experimental design's results showed that the use of apparently interchangeable active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and filler sorts that comply with pharmacopoeial specifications, lead to different end-product critical attributes. By adapting critical granulation parameters (i.e. binder spray rate and atomizing pressure) as a function of material characteristics, led to granules with average sizes comprised in a narrow range of 280 – 320 µm and low non-granulated fraction of under 5%. Therefore, the accurate control of process parameters according to the formulation particularities achieved the maintenance of product within the design space and removed material related variability. To complete the Quality by design (QbD) strategy, despite its limited spectral domain, the microNIR spectrometer was successfully used as a robust PAT monitoring tool that offered a real time overview of the moisture level and allowed the supervision and control of the granulation process.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (165KB)Download full-size image"
16,"Highlights•NH3 emission was decreased by Green UreaNV® (45–55%) and polymer-coated urea (80%).•Extra cost of Green UreaNV® can be outweighed by reduced environmental cost of NH3.•New fertilizer technology is needed to develop cost-effective polymer-coated urea.AbstractMitigating ammonia (NH3) volatilization from intensive pasture systems is critical for environmental sustainability. However, field-scale evaluation on the potential of enhanced efficiency fertilizers (e.g. urease inhibitors and controlled-release fertilizers) in mitigating NH3 volatilization is limited. Using a micrometeorological technique, we conducted two field trials to investigate the effects of Green UreaNV® (urea coated with the urease inhibitor N-(n-butyl)thiophosphoric triamide, NBPT) and polymer-coated urea (a controlled-release fertilizer) on NH3 volatilization from an intensive rainfed pasture in southern Australia. We found that NH3 volatilization from urea was 5.8 and 5.6 kg N ha–1, respectively, in the autumn and spring trials, equivalent to 11–12% of the applied urea in each season. The use of Green UreaNV® and polymer-coated urea decreased the cumulative NH3 volatilization by 45–55% and 80%, respectively. Taking into consideration the high environmental damage cost of NH3 as found in the European Union, we hypothesize that both Green UreaNV® and polymer-coated urea can be cost-effective in mitigating NH3 loss from this pasture. Our findings suggest that the extra cost of using these enhanced efficiency fertilizers for farmers is not compensated by the fertilizer N value of decreased NH3 loss. However, from a societal perspective the extra cost for Green UreaNV® is likely outweighed by reduced environmental cost of NH3. New fertilizer technology should be developed to improve the cost-effectiveness of polymer-coated urea to the farmers."
17,"Highlights•Herbicide resistance gene flow in weeds is under-estimated and under-appreciated.•The consequences are increasing occurrence of multiple-resistant weed populations. and dwindling efficacy of remaining herbicide tools.•The best mitigation strategy is weed seed bank management.AbstractInterest in the magnitude and consequences of intra- and inter-specific herbicide resistance gene flow, particularly that mediated by pollen, increased in the mid-1990s with the introduction of herbicide-resistant (HR) transgenic crops. During that time, less attention was paid to the movement of HR alleles via pollen or seed among weed populations. Incidence of HR weeds in a region is often attributed to independent evolution through herbicide selection; the role or contribution of HR allele movement via pollen, seeds and/or vegetative propagules is often under-estimated and under-appreciated. Once a new HR weed biotype has been confirmed in a jurisdiction, how often have we been surprised at its rapid areawide expansion? In genotypic studies of HR weed populations, the contribution of gene flow to incidence of resistance is frequently similar or greater than that of independent evolution. Simulation models have consistently predicted that frequent widespread applications of highly effective herbicides (e.g., acetolactate synthase inhibitors, glyphosate) provide connective high-fitness habitats across the landscape, which facilitate a rapid increase in the frequency and movement of an HR trait within and among populations. Such habitats, characterized by minimal heterogeneity but high selection intensity due to frequent herbicide ‘on’ vs. ‘off’ exposure periods, strongly favour the fitness of HR propagules at great disadvantage of herbicide-susceptible individuals. The unanticipated speed of areawide expansion of some HR weed biotypes has spurred numerous calls over the past decade for a collective community or regional response to mitigate this unhindered spread of HR alleles. The best mitigation strategy is minimizing weed population abundance and seed bank replenishment in fields and adjacent ruderal areas. This goal is difficult, but necessary for preserving the remaining public good and common pool resource of herbicide susceptibility."
18,"Highlights•Grazed beef and sheep production has low efficiencies of nitrogen (N) use.•Grassland N use efficiency can be enhanced through sward-inclusion of clover.•Replacing chemical-N fertiliser with biological N fixation did not affect yields.•During reseeding grasslands become a carbon source.•After establishment new swards become a carbon sink.AbstractThere is currently much debate around the environmental implications of ruminant farming and a need for robust data on nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) fluxes from beef and sheep grazing systems. Here we use data collected from the North Wyke Farm Platform along with the SPACSYS model to examine the N and C budgets and the N use efficiency (NUE) of grassland swards at different stages of establishment. We assessed the transition from permanent pasture (PP) to a high-sugar grass (HSG), and a mixed sward of HSG with white clover (HSGC), identifying data specifically for the reseed (RS) years and the first year following RS (HSG-T and HSGC-T). Dominant fluxes for the N budget were N offtake as cut herbage and via livestock grazing, chemical-N fertiliser and N leaching at 88–280, 15–177, and 36–92 kg N ha−1 a−1, respectively. Net primary productivity, soil respiration and C offtake as cut herbage and via livestock grazing at 1.9–15.9, 1.74–12.5, and 0.34–11.7 t C ha−1 a−1, respectively, were the major C fluxes. No significant differences were found between the productivity of any of the swards apart from in the RS year of establishment. However, NUE of the livestock production system was significantly greater for the HSGC and HSGC-T swards at 32 and 42% compared to all other swards, associated with the low chemical-N fertiliser inputs to these clover-containing swards. Our findings demonstrate opportunities for improving NUE in grazing systems, but also the importance of setting realistic NUE targets for these systems to provide achievable goals for land-managers.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (153KB)Download full-size image"
19,"Highlights•Ground cover management clearly increased insect abundance at the ground level.•Few families dominated both epigeal and canopy insect assemblages.•Total biodiversity was higher in cover crop treatments than tillage.•Native plants positively influence generalist epigeal predator abundance and richness.AbstractSustainable agriculture requires the support of new tools for successful and low-impact management of pests and diseases at global and local scales. The implementation of cover crops is considered a promising alternative ecological structure for sustainable agriculture, because they provide refuge to natural enemies of pests. Specifically, we hypothesised that implementing cover crop vegetation in a vineyard can enhance populations of natural enemies as a measure to support conservation biological control. We analysed insect abundance and diversity on Vitis vinifera var. Tempranillo (clon RJ-26, rootstock “110-Richter”) in a Mediterranean vineyard located in La Rioja, Spain from spring to autumn 2016–2017. Two types of sampling systems (pitfall traps and vacuum sampling) were used in each of the three evaluated ground cover management approaches (n = 3): (i) tillage, (ii) spontaneous cover, and (iii) flower-driven cover. A total of 58 families that belonged to four functional subgroups of insects (predators, parasitoids, phytophagous insects, and pollinators) were found. Overall, differences among the three treatments were only detected for total abundance of insects collected in the ground traps, and the “spontaneous cover” treatment showed significantly higher predator richness and abundance. However, the higher Shannon–Wiener value was recorded for “flower-driven cover” at both the ground and canopy levels. In addition, the abundance of predators, parasitoids and phytophagous insects in the ground traps for both cover crop treatments was more than two times higher than that observed in “tillage” treatment. Several predator taxa, such as ants, ground beetles, earwigs, and vespoid wasps had significantly higher representation under spontaneous cover treatment. Moreover, for parasitoids, the “flower-driven cover” treatment revealed higher Hill numbers values (0D, 1D, and 2D) at the canopy level, although no significant differences were observed. These results indicate that vegetation cover could be used to promote beneficial entomofauna in vineyards and thus be an effective conservation biological control tool."
20,"Highlights•Paper describes a novel method for soil fertilisation characterisation.•Fertilizer can be characterized by using its drop distribution pattern.•There is a correlation between deposition pattern and a fertiliser concentration.•Potassium has a most observable distribution pattern.AbstractThe paper proposes a novel method for characterisation of the fertilised soil properties based on a dried-drop analysis. The method consists of a solution extraction from a soil and water mixture, dry pattern formation and image analysis. The soil solution distribution patterns are obtained for pure and fertilised soils indicating fertiliser impact on the pattern morphology. The results obtained allow identification of structural variations in the soil drop patterns that correlate with the added fertiliser. The classification results show that 79% of the soil samples with a single-fertiliser solution can be correctly classified. The impact of the fertilisers and soil textures on the distribution-pattern morphology is shown."
21,"Highlights•Defining layout design and resource allocation as an integrated problem.•Developing an optimization model for optimizing resource allocation.•Imbedded layout algorithms within the simulation to optimize layout design.•Developing a simulation-based optimization approach to solve the integrated problem.•Potential daily saving of 20.64% or $1421.44 within grafting industry (case study)AbstractOptimal facility layout planning is needed for building or retrofitting production facilities (industrial or agricultural) in order to maximize production capacity and efficiency. In labor-intensive agricultural plant production facilities, this process is especially complicated due to the uncertainties surrounding the dynamicity of workers’ performance and plant growth affected by climate conditions. In this work, a simulation-based optimization framework is developed to simultaneously find the optimal facility layout design and resource allocation applicable for vegetable grafting nurseries that involve highly labor-intensive young plant production with multiple operational stages. In particular, optimal layout algorithms are embedded within the simulation model in order to find an optimal layout design given available resources. The proposed model can be customized based on workers’ individual performance and managerial design preferences. When applied to a case study of designing a new greenhouse nursery, results reveal that our proposed framework can lead to a potential daily savings of 20.64% or $1421.44 on average in terms of labor, utility, and amortized costs."
22,"Highlights•The trajectories of the same potato under different initial orientations were significantly different at a fixed initial speed, which were caused by potato rotations.•The influence degree of the initial orientation was related to the initial speed.AbstractConveyor transfer is one of the main transportation ways in potato production processing. The conveyor trajectory is a complex function of object size, shape, initial speed and so on. Potato trajectories are important to settle camera orientation when potato qualities were detected after discharging from a moving conveyor. Besides, action unit of the removal system and installation location of an unloading conveyor was influenced by the potato trajectories. The goal of this study was to investigate initial orientation influence on potato trajectories at different initial speeds by using quadratic coefficients. It was found that the potato trajectories were influenced significantly by initial orientations. Further, the influence extent was related to initial speeds. The influence was decreasing with initial speeds increasing, and there would be a relatively stable state as initial speed higher than 2.0 m/s. Calculation methods of guide mechanism length and installation location of the unloading conveyor were presented. The guide mechanism length was 200 mm at falling height 200 mm, and the x-coordinate of the unloading conveyor at falling height 400 mm was 174 mm when the initial orientation influence was ignored at initial speed 1.0 m/s."
23,"Highlights•Mounting behavior is typical behavior of cows during estrus.•Background Subtraction with Color and Texture Features (BSCTF) was proposed to detect cows.•Geometric and optical flow characteristics of the cows’ regions were obtained.•These characteristics was used to identify mounting behavior of cows.•Provided an effective reference for detecting cows estrus.AbstractComputer vision technology may improve the accuracy and robustness of estrus detection in dairy cows. In this study, we proposed a method for detecting mounting behavior in dairy cattle using the geometric and optical flow characteristics of identified image regions in videos taken on dairy farms. Videos captured on a farm often have a complex background, which can interfere with target detection. In this study, we used masking technology to remove the unrelated background, converted the RGB color space to HSV color space, and adjusted the summation coefficients of the HSV channels to improve the contrast between the cows and background images. Subsequently, the proposed Background Subtraction with Color and Texture Features (BSCTF) algorithm was used to detect cow regions. Then, to perform inter-frame differential processing on detection regions, the geometric and optical flow characteristics of the regions were extracted, and seven optimized features were used to construct regional feature vectors. Finally, a support vector machine (SVM) classifier was trained to classify the detected regions into mounting regions and non-mounting regions, which allowed the identification of mounting behavior. We obtained accuracy and omission rates of this detection method of 98.3% and 6.4%, respectively. The average recognition accuracy and false positive rates of the SVM classifier were 90.9% and 4.2%, respectively. These results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective for detecting the mounting behavior of dairy cows and is convenient for further judging whether cows are in estrus."
24,"Highlights•The use of shading screens can have negative effects on buildings ventilation.•Air flow parameters are difficult to estimate given the complex screens texture.•Porosity estimation has been carried out through image analysis process.•Computational fluid dynamics model allows to investigate air flow through a screen.•Novel methodologies are available for the fluid-dynamics parameters of screens.AbstractShading screens are broadly used in the protected cultivation sector, since they allow both to reduce the heat load and thus to control temperature, and to have lower and uniform levels of light intensity inside greenhouses. Various types of shading screens are available on the market, with different colors, material and textures. The choice of the best screen depends on the specific application and needs of the grower. Despite this, some screens can negatively affect ventilation and indoor climate, since their porosity can generate extra mass, heat and momentum transfer resistance. Most studies have evaluated the screen-related parameters, such as permeability and porosity, and the screen effect on ventilation referring to screens with simple and regular textures. In this paper, these parameters have been measured for three screen types available on the market using different approaches for their characterization. A novel approach based on image analysis together with wind tunnel tests has been set up to yield the permeability and inertial coefficient. On the other hand, a computational methodology based on CFD modeling has been carried out in order to obtain the relation between air velocity through a screen and the relative pressure drop, avoiding any experiment. The CFD methodology has been developed and validated, with the aim to possibly derive the parameters of different screens through simulations rather than more demanding experiments feasible only with specific equipment. In particular, a portion of the whole screen has been chosen for CFD simulations and the numerical results have been validated by a comparison with Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) data. This has allowed both to improve the model and to evaluate its effectiveness in simulating this specific fluid dynamics domain. By these novel approaches, the basis for extending the knowledge about the characterization of the screens used in agriculture have been laid.Graphical abstractDownload high-res image (289KB)Download full-size image"
25,"Highlights•An aerial robotic system for pre-harvest monitoring of orchards.•Fully autonomous and safe in-row navigation.•Complete visual coverage of yield.AbstractWe present an autonomous aerial system which can safely navigate inside the rows of an orchard for crop inspection, yield estimation and similar farm management tasks. Our operating environment has two practical constraints: GPS signal can be unreliable close to the ground and the trees can grow large branches that might block the robot’s predetermined path. To address these challenges, we developed components for navigation, vision-based obstacle detection and avoidance and path planning for visual coverage. Results from a field demonstration in an apple orchard are presented showcasing the ability of our system to perform successful navigation and complete yield coverage of apple tree rows."
26,"Highlights•The air generated in pesticide treatments with axial fan sprayers should be studied.•Air can be an environmental problem with the formation of atmospheric spray drift.•The air of a sprayer in static and dynamic position has been characterized.•The movement of the sprayer reinforced the asymmetric behaviour of the fan.•Vegetation can influence on the trajectories of air currents to the atmosphere.AbstractAir assisted sprayers are currently used for the applications of plant protection products in fruit trees and vineyards. However, the use of these equipment carries a high environmental risk, mainly owing to the generation of airborne spray drift in the lower boundary layer above crop canopy. Hence, many tests are currently focused on investigating several factors that affect the efficiency of the spray process, in which air assistance and air behaviour are two of the most difficult parameters to evaluate. This present work proposes a first approach on the characterization of the airflow generated by an orchard sprayer equipped with an axial fan and an air reverse system in the outlet plane of the air, while circulated through two artificial rows of canopy representing vineyard trellis, using 3D-ultrasonic anemometers to measure the experimental data. A first series of static field tests measured the air velocity at different heights on both sides of the sprayer and at both sides of every row of artificial canopy and evaluated the effect of the canopy on the sprayer airflow passing through. A second set of experiments were carried out with the sprayer moving at 4.1 km h−1 between canopy rows to simulate the normal spray process. Finally, velocity vectors and turbulent intensities were calculated. The resistance of the vegetation was also characterized by using a drag coefficient, both when the sprayer was stationary and moving. The results between the static and dynamic tests were compared. Although there were similarities between the two tests, the results indicated that when the equipment moves along the canopy rows, the axial fan asymmetry on air velocities is more noticeable and turbulence intensity increased. In addition, the vegetation received direct airflow at different times. This could affect the trajectory of the droplets. On the other hand, the resistance of the vegetation on each side was similar. The air reverse system could be affecting the airflow direction to the driving direction. Ultrasonic anemometers were successful in characterizing sprayer fan airflows but it is necessary to continue working on the descriptive analysis of the airflow in other planes different from the air outlet only and with other vineyard systems."
27,"Highlights•Body temperature at various sites was monitored using implantable wireless thermometer.•3 endoceliac and 7 subcutaneous temperatures were measured and compared.•Endoceliac temperatures showed good correlation with rectal temperature.•High correlation with endoceliac temperature was obtained from subcutaneous temperature by applying machine learning.AbstractMonitoring of cattle body temperature is useful for the detection of estrus, prediction of parturition, and maintenance of health. Recently, methods of monitoring body temperature in sites including the rumen, vagina, skin surface, and subcutis, have been studied. However, these methods are associated with limitations, such as loss of a device and the induction of stress. In addition, these studies did not consider differences among the measurement sites. In the present study, we developed implantable wireless thermometers and implanted them into a cow in 10 different anatomical locations. We then investigated the relationships among the temperatures recorded at these locations and rectal temperature (RT). The temperatures in three endoceliac and seven subcutaneous locations were monitored and compared over 6 weeks during winter. The temperatures in the abdominal cavity and inner flank wall correlated strongly with RT (r = 0.74 and 0.76, respectively). Of the subcutaneous locations, the tail-base (TB) was associated with a high reception rate for wireless transmission (97.6%) and the temperatures at this location also correlated well with RT (r = 0.62). These results indicate that the implantable wireless thermometer can continuously monitor core body temperature over a long period. Endoceliac sites and the TB are good candidates for bovine temperature monitoring. In addition, we were able to predict body temperatures that strongly correlated with the temperatures at endoceliac sites using machine learning and inputs of subcutaneous and ambient temperatures. The correlation coefficients were 0.93 when seven subcutaneous temperatures were used, and 0.77 when two were used. These results suggest that long-term monitoring of core body temperature would be possible using a wireless thermometer implanted in a subcutaneous location."
